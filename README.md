# AT-370_Schematics
This is a reverse engineered set of schematics for the AT/370, also known as the PC/370-P2 and PC/370-M2.

This repository has one library, AT370, which has all symbols not included in the base libraries.

There are/will be two projects, PC-370_P2 and PC-370_M2 for the two respective boards that make up the boardset.

Photos/scans of my board exist here on bitsavers:
